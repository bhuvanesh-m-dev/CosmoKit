## 📁 Structure & Purpose

Each subfolder in this repository represents **a single asset**, and contains:

| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `mars_image/` | A folder for a Mars-related asset |
| ├── `mars.jpg` | The actual image or file |
| └── `README.md` | Contains credits, license, source, and usage instructions |

This structure ensures:
- Clear **attribution for each file**
- Easy **copy-paste credits** for other projects
- Organized asset reuse across multiple tools (e.g., CosmoDB, CosmoTalker)
